## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal to see the versions installed. If these commands fail, you need to install Node.js and npm first.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the app repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnudeepGI/dibberfamily.git
cd dibberfamily
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Run the App

Start the app by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. 

After the server starts, it will display a button on the webpage. Once you click on that button, the React Modal will be displayed.
